# Running code
   ## MATLAB 
   Type >>shallow_water_model at the command prompt
   
   To do the plots in the MATLAB version type >>animate after running the model
   ## Python 
   Can be run from ipython, by typing run -i shallow_water_model.py
   
   To do the plots in the python version type run -i animate.py after running the model
   ## C++ and CUDA: 
   Navigate into the c++ folder and follow the instructions in the readme file.
   
   Currently no plotting functions.
   
   Table of calculation time for nx = 1440, ny = 720, timesteps = 1min, forecast 4 days, single precision.
